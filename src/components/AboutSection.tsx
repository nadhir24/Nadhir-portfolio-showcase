            Hello! I'm Nadhir, a developer passionate about creating digital experiences that live on the internet.
            My interest in web development started back when I was in university, where I began exploring how to build
            websites and web applications.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Universitas Gunadarma in December 2022.
            During my time there, I actively learned coding and developed various projects to enhance my skills.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            I've also completed a 3-month onsite Fullstack Node.js Bootcamp at Code X Academy in 2023,
            where I honed my skills in building full-stack applications. I've recently completed a project called
            <a href="https://ranocake.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-portfolio-teal hover:underline"> ranocake</a>,
            which showcases my abilities as a web developer.
          </p>
